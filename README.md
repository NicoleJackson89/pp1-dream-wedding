# Dream Weddings

## [View the website here](https://nicolejackson89.github.io/pp1-dream-wedding/)

As a service provider, Dream weddings was created to showcase what we as wedding planners can do for couples who plan to get married in the near future.

The site is directly targered to engaged couples who require assistance with thier overall wedding planning needs. A gallery was added to provide a visual guide for the types of possible wedding themes and previous weddings created by us.

- Footer

  - The footer has links to our social media pages, these will open up in a new tab tor ease of navigation for users.
  - Company contact details have been added to the footer as I have taken into consideration that some users may want to get straight into contacting us rather than search for the details in another page.
  - The social media links have added animation that will increase in size when the user hovers over either of them.
