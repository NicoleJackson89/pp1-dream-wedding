## [View the website here](https://nicolejackson89.github.io/pp1-dream-wedding/)

As a service provider, Dream weddings was created to showcase what we as wedding planners can do for couples who plan to get married in the near future.

The site is directly targered to engaged couples who require assistance with thier overall wedding planning needs. A gallery was added to provide a visual guide for the types of possible wedding themes and previous weddings created by us.

## User Experience 

The target market of this webpage would be all couples who are looking for guidance / assisstance with planning their wedding.

Users will be looking for clear, easy to read information about what we as a company can offer to their stressfree wedding planning process. A photo gallery is provided as users will see this as a reference for the type of service we offer to our clients and previous work we have done. Pictures speak a million words in a website like this.
 
 The webpage is easy to navigate, has a soft color pallette with no over whelming amounts of content to read through. At first glance the websage offers animation of the logo as well as a beautiful image of a table setting at a wedding we planned.

### Color Palette

The color plalette used for the web page was considered, the look and feel I wanted for the website was soft but ellegant. I achieved this buy making use of both Hex and RGBA colors throughout the web page with a simple white background.

### Color Contrast

After running the website through a color contrast validator I was pleased to see the chosen colors work well together.

### Existing Features

This website was designed on desktop view first as I thought this would be the most likely way users will search for the services of a wedding planner.

- Logo and Navigation Bar

  - Both the Logo and Nav Bar were styled inline for a easy flow to the page.

- Footer

  - The footer has links to our social media pages, these will open up in a new tab tor ease of navigation for users.
  - Company contact details have been added to the footer as I have taken into consideration that some users may want to get straight into contacting us rather than search for the details in another page.
  - The social media links have added animation that will increase in size when the user hovers over either of them.

- Gallery

  - The gallery has been added to provide users with supporting images of our work.
  - The border radius was intentional to create a softer, welcoming look to the images.
  - Images in the gallery would be of value to users as they would be a deciding factor of whether or not to contact us to provide a service to them.
  - I have taken smaller screens into consideration, the gallery become smaller with the number of columns when screen sizes decrease.

## Testing

- HTML and CSS code was tested throught the building process of this web page using the W3C validator to fix any errors or warnings. This was to ensure a smoother final testing period at the end of the building process.

### HTML Validator

- All of the HTML pages were passed through the official [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) no errors were found.
- A warning has come up for the Gallery HTML page, a section was used without a heading. This was fixed by replacing the section element with a div element.
- Other warnings have come up due to the usage of two or more consectutive hyphens used in comments, I made a concise desicion to leave these as they help with code location on the pages.

### CSS Validator

- No errors were found when validating my CSS code through the official [W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- A warning has come back for my Google fonts import, I made a concise decision to leave this as it does not affect the overall website. The warning is a notification that the validator will not validate my imported Google font.

### Lighthouse

I used the Lighthouse Google Chrome dev tools feature to test the wedsite in mobile and desktop view. 

- Desktop

  - The performance score was affected here due to the Home page images being a larger property size.
