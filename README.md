As a service provider, Dream weddings was created to showcase what we as wedding planners can do for couples who plan to get married in the near future.

The site is directly targered to engaged couples who require assistance with thier overall wedding planning needs. A gallery was added to provide a visual guide for the types of possible wedding themes and previous weddings created by us.

- Footer

  - The footer has links to our social media pages, these will open up in a new tab tor ease of navigation for users.
  - Company contact details have been added to the footer as I have taken into consideration that some users may want to get straight into contacting us rather than search for the details in another page.
  - The social media links have added animation that will increase in size when the user hovers over either of them.

- Gallery

  - The gallery has been added to provide users with supporting images of our work.
  - The border radius was intentional to create a softer, welcoming look to the images.
  - Images in the gallery would be of value to users as they would be a deciding factor of whether or not to contact us to provide a service to them.
  - I have taken smaller screens into consideration, the gallery become smaller with the number of columns when screen sizes decrease.
