# Dream Weddings

## [View the website here](https://nicolejackson89.github.io/pp1-dream-wedding/)

As a service provider, Dream weddings was created to showcase what we as wedding planners can do for couples who plan to get married in the near future.

The site is directly targered to engaged couples who require assistance with thier overall wedding planning needs. A gallery was added to provide a visual guide for the types of possible wedding themes and previous weddings created by us.

## Features

This website was designed on desktop view first as I thought this would be the mostl likely way users will research about wedding planners.

### _Logo and Navigation Bar_

- Both the Logo and Nav Bar were styled inline for a easy flow to the page.

- The logo is fully responsive. No matter which page your are on in the website, by clikcing on the logo you will be redirected back to the Home page.
- Animation was added to the logo with a zoom-in effect as an eye catching experience for users.

### _Navigation Bar_

- The nav bar is featured on all three pages of the website with links to the Home, Gallery and Contact Us pages.
- Users will easily navigate to these pages using any device without having to make use of the back button on the browser.
- The links on the nav bar have been styled in a way that users will know which page they are currently in on the website.
